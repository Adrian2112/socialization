= Socialization

Socialization is a Ruby Gem that allows any model to Follow and/or Like any other model. This is accomplished through a double polymorphic relationship on the Follow and Like models. But you don't need to know that since all the complexity is hidden from you.

== Installation

=== Rails 3 Support

Add the gem to the gemfile:
  gem "socialization"

Run the generator:
  rails generate socialization

This will generate two migration files and two models named Follow and Like. You may delete the Follow or Like model and migration if you don't need that functionality in your application.

=== Rails 2.3.x Support

This gem requires Rails 3 or better. Sorry!

== Usage

=== Setup

Allow a model to be followed:
  class Celebrity < ActiveRecord::Base
    ...
    acts_as_followable
    ...
  end

Allow a model to be a follower:
  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    ...
    acts_as_follower
    ...
  end


Allow a model to be liked:
  class Movie < ActiveRecord::Base
    ...
    acts_as_likeable
    ...
  end

Allow a model to like:
  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    ...
    acts_as_liker
    ...
  end

Or a more complex case where users can like and follow each other:
  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    ...
    acts_as_follower
    acts_as_followable
    acts_as_liker
    acts_as_likeable
    ...
  end

== Similar Projects

acts_as_follower[https://github.com/tcocca/acts_as_follower] is a similar project that I only discovered when I was 95% finished writing the first version of Socialization. I initially intended to name this project acts_as_follower only to find out the name was taken. You might want to check it out as well so see which one suits your needs better. Socialization is simpler, supports "Likes" and easilly extendable; acts_as_follower has more "Follow" features.
